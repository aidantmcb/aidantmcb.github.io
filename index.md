Hello! I'm Aidan McBride, an undergraduate astronomy student at Western Washington University.

Some of my research is pinned at [my github page](https://github.com/aidantmcb). Up to this point, my research has focused primarily on [modeling dust extinction](https://github.com/aidantmcb/dust_extinction_temperature), [stellar kinematics](https://github.com/aidantmcb/OrionProperMotions), and [stellar classification](https://github.com/aidantmcb/YSO-ML) using neural networks. 

I'll be working on making this a functional page over time. Stay tuned!
