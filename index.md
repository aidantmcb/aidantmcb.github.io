Hello! I'm Aidan McBride, graduate student in astrophysics at the University of Utah. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at Western Washington University.

Some of my research is pinned at [my github page](https://github.com/aidantmcb). My research interests revolve around the Milky Way's interstellar medium - how clouds of cold molecular material form from the diffuse ISM and how their dynamics impact their history of star formation.

My undergraduate research focused primarily on [modeling dust extinction](https://github.com/aidantmcb/dust_extinction_temperature), [stellar kinematics](https://github.com/aidantmcb/OrionProperMotions), and [stellar classification](https://github.com/aidantmcb/YSO-ML) using neural networks. 

I'll be working on making this a functional page over time. Stay tuned!
